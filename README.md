## Mechanics

*For more detailed information, see http://mod.jorbs.tv/about*

* **Memories**: The Wanderer can gain buffs and debuffs by **Remembering** memories. But, memory is a fickle thing; old memories slip away as new ones are remembered.
* **Clarity**: Prevent memories from slipping away by gaining Clarity of them.
* **Snap**: The Spire is a maddening place; spend too long in a floor and watch your memories come tumbling down upon you.
* **Material Components**: A grab bag of 0-cost cards with different minor effects. The Wanderer has several ways to acquire them in combat, including...
* **The Grimoire**: Just before Snap overtakes you, The Grimoire will begin seeping its way into your hand, granting a seemingly endless supply of Material Components; but at what cost?
* **Burning**: Deals damage at the start of each turn. Burning prevents healing, falls off by 33% each turn, and is affected by enemy Block.
* **Legendary**: Certain cards (including The Grimoire) are Legendary; they have a special card frame, and can only be found once per run.
* **Entomb**: Some cards begin each combat Entombed in your Exhaust pile, only to return to your hand when certain conditions are met.
